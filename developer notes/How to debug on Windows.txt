1. download and install safari browser (its the only one that the debugger runs in for me)

2. open windows explorer and go to the folder with your code (assuming your start file is called server.js)

3. run this command

npm install -g node-inspector


4. open new cmd window and run
node --debug app.js

5. open another cmd windows and run
node-inspector

 you'll see a message that node inspector is running...


6. in safari browse to the debugger by going to
http://localhost:8080/debug?port=5858
, set a breakpoint

7. in chrome open your page = e.g. localhost:8000


8. back to safari and you are debugging !!
